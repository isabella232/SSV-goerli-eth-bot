                  **2.** Twice a day I will announce about an hour(might change from time to time) in advance before the \n
                   BOT Channel is open for messages. \n **3.** After the channel is open you can send your commands to the BOT. \n

                      **3.** If you made a deposit before but failed to register the validator with the same wallet to the  \n

                      **4.** There will be 2 cycles a day with about 1-hour announcement in advance (in this channel) once in  \n
                      the morning and again about 5-8 hours later UTC+2 \n
                      **5.** In each cycle the deposit channel may open and close a few times according to the number of \n
                      requests in the queue and the cycle is officially ended when the announced. \n
                      **6.** Trying to abuse the bot will result in a ban, disqualification from the testnet, and block. \n
                      **7.** Slow mode is enabled and set to 6 hours. This is to avoid abuse or BOT crashing. Make sure you \n
